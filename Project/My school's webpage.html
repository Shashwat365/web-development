<h1>History

    </h2>
    Founded in 1966, Sharada Mandir School was set up to fulfil the long-felt need for quality education in the State of Goa from the Elementary level to the Secondary level. Sharada Mandir School, Miramar, is the first school in Goa to be affiliated to the Council for the Indian School Certificate Examinations (CISCE). The school is made up of five different sections: Elementary, Junior, Middle, Secondary and Higher Secondary, integrally interlinked by a common thread of commitment to academic excellence and holistic development of its students, offering the curricula of the Indian Certificate of Secondary Education (ICSE) up to Std. 10 and Indian School Certificate (ISC) in Stds. 11 and 12. Sharada Mandir Miramar came under new management in the year 2003 and has now grown to the present strength of around 2400 students and 190 staff members. A low student-faculty ratio encourages strong relationships and invites interaction between teachers and students leading to holistic quality education.

At the Elementary level, children between 3 to 5 years of age receive a fun, activity-based introduction to the learning of basic concepts, perception, audio visual understanding and expression – a process that stimulates creativity and imagination, essentially consistent with their future growth. The curriculum is flexible, self-directed and explores individual interests.

The transition to the Junior Section is both gradual and accommodating. We believe that the friendly, supportive, yet challenging atmosphere in this section is conducive for mutual reciprocity while expanding knowledge and character.

As students inch upwards to the Secondary level, we focus on teaching them how to develop a clear, creative and comprehensive thinking process while learning to communicate ideas, facts and feelings confidently and effectively.

In the Higher Secondary Section, we offer our students Science, Commerce and Humanities streams and treat them as distinctive individuals, giving them autonomy over their creativity whilst still attending to their needs.

Higher thinking and intensive training take place to prepare them for further studies in other parts of the country as well as internationally.

Sports and co-curricular activities like music, art and drama are integral parts of every section in keeping with the very high standards of education of the ICSE Board and the ISC Board. As part of holistic development, these serve as mediums to make each student a responsible, conscious and proactive citizen of society. The school also conducts several outreach programmes to sensitise students towards the lesser privileged sections of society. School counsellors, in association with old age homes and orphanages, arrange sessions wherein their residents interact with our students. Sharada Mandir School has also been associated with the National Association for the Blind (NAB) and our senior students have served as readers and writers for the NAB.

A second school and campus, Sharada Mandir School, Kadamba, was established in June 2021 at Goalim Moula on Kadamba plateau. With this second school, the time-proven and trusted Sharada Mandir School ethos, curriculum and learning are accessible to more students by virtue of its geographical location and additional student capacity. This school features state of the art infrastructure, spacious and modern classrooms, indoor and outdoor play areas, along with all other required resources and facilities, including high speed internet connectivity. Sharada Mandir Kadamba mirrors the academic structure of the Miramar school while offering classes from Nursery 1 (Elementary level) to Std. 8 (Secondary level). Every year, higher class levels will be added, up to Std.12 at the Higher Secondary level.

Sharada Mandir Trust is dedicated to expanding the educational vistas of both its schools and to make their activities broad-based and relevant to the times. Each school’s overall setup is large enough to provide all required resources and facilities and yet small enough to offer a personalized approach towards the primary needs of every individual student. Both schools provide round the clock CCTV camera surveillance and security around the campus.

Our team of dedicated staff constantly ensures close interaction, individual attention and care since our goal is to always keep our students and their best interests at the centre of all that we do.

We believe that Sharada Mandir Schools embody the value of all things endure!
